      <description>Github | CS B.S. Requirements | CS&amp;amp;E (Public)
Welcome, incoming CS freshmen! I threw together this page with things that I personally found helpful to know. Hopefully it helps you as well.
Core CS Classes  Things to note:
 I am not a data-science major, so my map doesn&amp;rsquo;t include those courses. The CS/DS double-major is popular, but you would need to ask someone else about it.  If you make a data science chart and want to add it, open an issue or make a pull request on the Github page   CS 200 is not a requirement for the major, but is a good introduction.</description>
